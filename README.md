# *LaTeX* Documents

![The LaTeX logo!](images/latex.svg "latex logo")
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. These are some LaTeX documents I prepared for my school assignments and personal learning. 

Personally, I make use of TeXStudio to prepare my LaTeX documents. It is a requirement to get a compiler to compile LaTeX code. I personally use MikTex for this purpose.

Overleaf is a very good learning platform if you want to get started using LaTeX. It also has its own online compiler. See below links to the various tools required to get you started.
